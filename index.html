        <p><em>Transitioning <strong>US Navy Sailor</strong> and Aspiring <strong>Front End Developer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I'm a Chef in the US Navy, I've worked in a diverse range of ships and bases throughout my several years in the military. It was not easy but through experience I learned to take charge and accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently.
          Im
          always looking for an opportunity to broaden my horizons. Always open to learn new things and challenge myself. I am looking to take my skills I learned and my leadership and independency I learned while being in the Navy and apply it into
          a tech
          role that I plan to pursue, specifically Front end development.</p>
